\begin{block}{Dominating Set}
    A dominating set for a graph \( G = (V, E) \) is a subset \( D \subseteq V \) such that every vertex not in \( D \) is adjacent to at least one vertex in \( D \).
\end{block}
    
    % Block 2: Unit Disk Graph
\begin{block}{Unit Disk Graph}
    A unit disk graph is a graph where each vertex represents a disk of unit diameter in the Euclidean plane. There is an edge between two points u and v if and only if the two unit disks centered at u and v have a nonempty intersection.
\end{block}
    
    % Block 3: CDS-UDG Problem
\begin{block}{CDS-UDG Problem}
    The Connected Dominating Set (CDS) problem in Unit Disk Graphs (UDGs) is to find a connected dominating set with minimum cardinality for the graph.

    %, ensuring that every node in the graph is either in the set or adjacent to a node in the set.
